### Increasing Stability and Reducing Friction to Increase Speed

- tumbleweed7536 on Discord suggested:

In case anyone is interested. I made a few changes to the design. The first is to increase speed by increasing stability and reducing friction on the carriage.

You can see I used 2 3” extrusions and put the weight of the carriage in rollers. The rollers are all mounted on bearings.
The other change I made was to use the extrusions to create tensioners and mount the belt with a plate.
