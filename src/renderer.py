# This script is executed as part of the GUI window process.
# In Python-based GUI frameworks (like PyQt5 or Tkinter), there is no direct
# separation of main and renderer processes like in Electron.
# Any functionality requiring elevated permissions or external APIs
# should be handled in separate threads or processes to avoid blocking the UI.
# Use proper Python modules to integrate required features into the GUI.
